What is the status of your project?

  Finished part one. Just starting to think about part two.

What has each team done to ensure the success of the team?

  Assume this means team-member? Part one was all about establishing communication and we've done that really well. Both of us were able to make essential changes to part one in order to make it function.

What can each team member do going forward to ensure the success of the team?

  In the future we will continue to work together and designate parts of the assignment to maximize efficiency and continue with forward progress.
